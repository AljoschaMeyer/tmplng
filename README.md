# Temp Lang

A small, restrictive,  programming language. This is not intended to actually be useful to code in. Instead, it provides a basis for some experiments regarding source code representation, distribution and collaboration.

The language is basically the simply typed lambda calculus, extended with simple algebraic data types, recursion, and a minimal module system.
